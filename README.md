# Full Stack Application Pair Project

Front-End Repo: https://github.com/melanieinpursuit/project-snack-a-log-frontend
Back-End Repo: https://github.com/Shaik-Kamil/project-snack-a-log-backend
Deployed Back-End: https://snack-a-log-project-backend.onrender.com/


## Snack-a-log

Create an app that allows users to log their favorite snacks. Add functionality that will enable users to see whether or not their snack is healthy based on a simple algorithm.

For this project, there are 45 features, points, functionalities to build. You are required to successfully reach a minimum of 32 points to pass this project.

## Overview

### Basic Instructions
- Using the [`project-snack-a-log-frontend`](https://github.com/9-1-pursuit/project-snack-a-log-frontend) and [`project-snack-a-log-backend`](https://github.com/9-1-pursuit/project-snack-a-log-backend) repos, create a full-stack web application by building the two applications and having them interact.
- Use Express to build a complete CRUD back-end application that adheres to RESTful routes.
- Deploy the applications separately so that anyone can see them online and the two online applications can interact.


### Groups
- You will be working in groups of 4 for this 4 day Sprint.
- One person should create a Trello board and add all members to it
- One person in the group should fork and clone the front end
- One person in the group should fork and clone the backend
- All group members should be added as collaborators to the repos
- One possibility for approach to working could be to partner 2 people on the frontend and partner 2 people on the backend
- It is up to you how you choose to work as a team


### Question Asking
- You will be given 4 tokens. These tokens represent the number of debugging questions **per team** you are allowed to ask an instructor during this complete sprint. (clarifying questions about the instructions are not included)

> ***Suggestion:*** It might be a good idea if you begin with the [Back-end setup](https://github.com/9-1-pursuit/project-snack-a-log-backend)) and then move on to the front-end, at least for planning.

### Point Structure<br />
> Total Frontend: 23 points<br />
> Total Backend: 21 points<br />
> Presentation: 1 point
> **Grand total**: 45 points

> **Note**: There are no front-end tests; your hosted application's functionality and code quality will be used to evaluate you.

## Getting Started

1. Navigate to your directory called `project-snack-a-log`.
1. `cd` into the directory.
1. Fork and clone the [`project-snack-a-log-front-end`](https://github.com/9-1-pursuit/project-snack-a-log-frontend) repo into your `project-snack-a-log` directory.
1. Change the name of your `project-snack-a-log-front-end` directory to `front-end`.

> **Note**: Your `back-end` directory should be adjacent to your `front-end` directory. Both should be their own git repositories. The top-level `project-snack-a-log` folder should **NOT** be a git repository.

### Front-end setup

It would be best if you opened a new terminal tab dedicated to running and developing your front-end.

- `cd front-end`
- `touch .env`

**.env**

```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:3333
```

- `npm install` - install npm packages listed in `package.json`.
- `npm start` - make sure your React app can start
